#Tic Tac Toe

- first I built the game the best way I could think of (and it worked). Then I decided to watch a tutorial by a professional web developer to learn how someone like that would approach this project. Finally I reworked my own project with the knowledge of the tutorial and better ways to go about building such a game. That way I did the task by myself at first, and then could still learn more about other (better/more efficient) ways of doing it. I find by doing this, it helps me quite a bit to start thinking more like a programmer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-GkMjUZsmM
learned more about pseudo elements (::before and ::after)
:not() comes in very handy, first wanted to use attribute selector like this '[class='cell']'. it ensures that elements with only(!) that class would be selected
make a better modal/result screen. in this case i didn't need a separate modal and overlay div, i could make it more compact into one single div which acts as the overlay and inside it are the message and the button i would have put in the modal otherwise
once:true this is so useful!
remove event listeners!!!
